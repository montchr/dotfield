      Berkeley Monoâ„¢ is a love letter to the golden era of computing.
      The era that gave rise to a generation of people who celebrated
      automation and reveled in the joy of computing, when transistors
      replaced cogs, and machine-readable typefaces were developed,
      for when humans and machines truly interfaced on an unprecedented scale.
