      # NOTE: Due to the this machine being initially-provisioned for
      # Windows, the boot partition is small (200MiB), which is very
      # much a Microsoft-ism (i.e. unreasonable).  While dual-boot is
      # obviously possible, we are limited to a very small number of
      # NixOS initrd images stored in the EFI filesystem.  Such a small
      # number could easily result in a state where it is not possible
      # to roll back to a known-good NixOS generation during a period of
      # active iteration where the bootloader is updated more than two
      # times in a single boot session.  That is, quite frankly, very
      # easy to hit when running `nixos-rebuild switch`.  Because the
      # NTFS Windows system partition is only ~16MiB away from the end
      # of the EFI partition, it is not possible to allocate more free
      # space for a re-created EFI partition without altering the start
      # sector for the NTFS partition (moving the start sector from the
      # left to the right), which is very likely to result in corruption
      # of the Windows operating system files. I already did that once
      # when I mistakenly tried to shrink the Windows partition from the
      # left to the right via GParted -- the entire Windows partition
      # then had to be deleted and re-provisioned by Klein IT support
      # staff.  That would have been fine, but the expanded EFI
      # partition I had created was accidentally deleted in the process
      # due to human error, thus resulting in the same tiny-EFI state I
      # was in before.  The second time around, I was able to shrink the
      # NTFS partition from within Windows, but the shrink moves the end
      # sector from right to left, which resulted in the desired total
      # space allocation for the EFI partition to be sandwiching the
      # NTFS partition.  The Windows disk management tool does not allow
      # for "moving" partitions, so I had to use GParted.  When I
      # attempted to move the NTFS partition to the right, however,
      # GParted warned that this would likely result in a corrupted
      # filesystem.  Not an experience I would like to put myself in
      # again.  One solution to the limited generation capacity in the
      # EFI partition could be storing the kernels and initrd on the
      # primary Linux partition, but that would require switching from
      # systemd-boot to GRUB.  Perhaps a project for a rainy day, as
      # long as there's nothing in my configuration that requires
      # systemd-boot.  For more on this subject, refer to:
