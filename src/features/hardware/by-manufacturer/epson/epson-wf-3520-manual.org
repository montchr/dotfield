6.4. Running Image Scan! for Linux

You can start Image Scan! for Linux either from the command line or menu or through the GIMP.

--------------

6.4.1. From the command line

--------------

At the command prompt, execute the following command to start Image Scan! for Linux.

Image Scan! for Linux starts. If more than one scanner are connected to the network, the Scan Selector dialog box appears.\\
See [[#sec6-4-4][“6.4.4. Scan Selector dialog box”]].\\

\\
\\

6.4.2. From the GIMP graphic software

--------------

You can also start Image Scan! for Linux from the GIMP.\\
In this case, the scanned image is transferred to the GIMP for further image manipulation instead of a file or printer.

As of version 1.15.0, iscan is automatically registered as a GIMP plugin if you install the binary package.\\
In case it didn't (because you built from source for example), you can register it yourself with the following command

Adjust the version number to match the version of the GIMP that you use.

Once iscan is registered as a plug-in, you can start it via the entry in the Xtns menu under the Acquire Image section.\\
Select Create from the File menu of GIMP, and then select Scanning (iscan).

Note: The menu configuration may differ depending on which version of GIMP that Image Scan! for Linux starts.\\
If more than one scanner is connected to the network, the Scan Selector dialog box appears.

\\
\\

6.4.3. Start from the menu

--------------

Select the icon of "Image Scan! for Linux" in the menu.\\

\\
\\

6.4.4. Scan Selector dialog box

--------------

If more than one scanner are connected to the network, the Scan Selector dialog box appears when you run Image Scan! for Linux.\\
Select a scanner you want to use, and then click OK.\\

The default format is “default-###.pnm” where ### stands for sequential numbers set in the Start filling at list box and the Number of digits list box.

6.6.2. Scanning to a Printer

--------------

You can send the scanned image to the printer specified in the Configuration dialog box.\\
Follow the steps below.

※To print the scanned image on an Epson printer,\\
we recommend you install Photo Image Print System Ver. 1.3.1 or later for high quality printing.

1. Modify the settings as you prefer in the main window.
2. Select Printer in the Destination list box.
3. If you are not using the default printer, click the Configuration button and then enter the print command. Click OK.
4. Click the Scan button. The scanned image is sent to the printer.

\\
\\

7. Configuring SANE Network

--------------

Image Scan! for Linux uses the SANE library to access your scanner(s).\\
This library contains a network module*1 that, with a little configuration, makes accessing scanners over the network a breeze.\\
This section explains how to get a network setup to work.\\
Here, a computer running Image Scan! for Linux is called “the client”, and the computer that is connected to the scanner is called “the server”*2.\\

For information on how to connect from Image Scan! for Linux to a scanner that is directly attached to the network, see [[#sec8][“8. Setting Network Plug-in.”]]

​*1 The SANE developers call this a backend, but other people may be more familiar with the term “driver”.\\
​*2 It is very well possible that the client and the server refer to the one and the same computer.

--------------

7.1. Setting Up the Client

--------------

On the client side, you need to check that the net module is enabled in /etc/sane.d/dll.conf and that the server(s) you want to use are listed in /etc/sane.d/net.conf.\\
Sample versions of the files may look like:

for a minimalistic network enabled dll.conf usable with iscan, and

for a simple two server net.conf. Hosts can be specified by name or by IP address.\\
Both files are plain text files and can be edited with your favorite text editor.\\
You do need root permissions to do this, though.\\
For more detailed information about these files (and more), refer to the sane-dll(5) and sane-net(5) manual pages.

You also need a sane entry in /etc/services, but installing Image Scan! for Linux should have taken care of that.\\
The required entry looks like:

You can easily find it with the following command:

\\
\\

7.2. Setting Up the Server

--------------

On the server side, you need to add the clients that are allowed to use the scanner(s) to the /etc/sane.d/saned.conf file.\\
A sample setup may look like:\\

For detailed information about the saned.conf file (and more), refer to the saned(1) manual page.

The server's /etc/sane.d/dll.conf should have the epkowa module enabled.\\
Installation of Image Scan! for Linux adds this module and enables it by default.

Just as on the client, the server's /etc/services needs a sane entry.\\
Again, the installation of Image Scan! for Linux should have taken care of that.

The saned daemon (the program that handles all SANE network scan requests) is typically started and stopped via the internet super-server: inetd or xinetd. If your system uses inetd, you need to add a line like

to your /etc/inetd.conf file and restart the daemon.\\
This requires root privileges. Restarting is typically achieved via

On xinetd based systems, you need to add a sane file in the /etc/xinetd.d/ directory and possibly tweak /etc/xinetd.conf.\\
A sample sane file is provided with Image Scan! for Linux in the documentation directory and looks like

Restart xinetd after adding the file.

\\
\\

7.3. Troubleshooting

Many factors play a role in networking and some of these may prevent your configuration from working.\\
Some of the more common, network related culprits are:

--------------

7.3.1. The sane service

--------------

Although the SANE documentation refers to it as the sane service, the IANA has registered it as the sane-port service.\\
This means that your systems may only have a sane-port service in its /etc/services file.\\
This can wreck havoc on your network scanner setup.\\
To fix this, you can:

1. add an alias to your /etc/services so the entry looks like
2. modify your /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/xinetd.d/sane file to use the sane-port service instead of the sane service.\\
   You may also have to adjust the /etc/hosts.allow and/or /etc/hosts.deny files (see below).

\\
\\

7.3.2. firewall

--------------

Many distributions allow you to set up a packet filtering firewall during installation.\\
If this firewall rejects or drops network packets directed at port 6566, the port used by saned, you will not be able to contact the scan server.\\
Note that both the server and client need to accept packets on the input and output chains.

\\
\\

7.3.3. TCP wrappers

--------------

Another access control mechanism that may prevent you from accessing saned on the server is tcpd.\\
This wrapper utility decides access based on information in the /etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny files.\\
Naturally, the server needs to allow the client and vice versa.\\
Refer to the hosts_access(5) manual page for details.

\\
\\

7.3.4. host name resolution

--------------

The saned daemon does reverse name lookups before it responds to scan requests.\\
This means that it checks whether host name and IP address match.\\
If your domain name service (DNS) server is slow to respond, misconfigured or temporarily unavailable,\\
reverse name lookups will fail and clients will not be allowed to connect.

\\
\\

8. Setting Network Plug-in

This chapter explains how to set the connection from Image Scan! for Linux to a scanner that is directly attached to the network.\\
By using the network plug-in, you can connect to a scanner that is directly attached to the network.\\
Please note that scanning over the network is only supported in a client/server setup.\\
Scanners directly attached to the network are not supported.

--------------

8.1. Installing Network Plug-in

--------------

When installing the network plug-in, Image Scan! for Linux must be already installed.\\
In most graphical environments, just double-click the Image Scan! forLinux binary package icon to install it.\\
If this does not work for you, install it from the command line with the least common denominator tools using the following steps:

1. Log in as a user with root privileges.
2. Execute the following command to install the network plug-in.
3. If you are not using the default printer, click the Configuration button and then enter the print command.\\
   \\
   Click OK.

\\
\\

8.2. Uninstalling Network Plug-in

--------------

1. Log in as a user with root privileges.
2. Execute the following command to uninstall the network plug-in.
3. If you are not using the default printer, click the Configuration button and then enter the print command.\\
   \\
   Click OK.

\\
\\

8.3. Setting Network Plug-in

--------------

1. Connect the scanner to the network and set the IP address.\\
   For information on how to set the IP address, refer to the user manual shipped with your scanner.
2. Please enter the information on your scanner in /etc/sane.d/epkowa.conf by using root privileges.
3. Start iscan. When starting, if it identifies the scanner on the network properly, it will work without any problems.\\
   At this time, if multiple scanners are connected, the Scan Selector dialog box is displayed just like when connected locally.\\
   See [[#sec6-4-4][“6.4.4. Scan Selector dialog box”]].\\

\\
