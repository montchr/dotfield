##: Background
# This particular configuration precludes the usage of Docker and Podman
# alongside each other. It aims to allow Podman to replace Docker and preserve
# compatibility with tools that expect Docker.
#
# For side-by-side Docker/Podman usage, exporting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment
# variable along these lines may work:
#
# $ export DOCKER_HOST="unix:///run/podman/podman.sock"
#
# And then `unset DOCKER_HOST` should restore the original Docker socket path.
