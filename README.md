My worlds and systems, a nutrient-rich collection of typos feeding the hungry
heads of a talking planet, "oriented toward an experimentation in contact with
the real".

## Disclaimerisms

These are my personal configurations and are not intended for use as a template,
but you are welcome to do so if you like! I hope visitors manage to find
something helpful/inspiring/interesting, but please keep in mind that _I have no
idea what I'm doing_.

Dotfield does not embody "best practices" or "the right way to Nix". The project
exists as an evolving and unstable result of one amateur's take on identifying
and implementing flexible and understandishable patterns or novelties across
other sources this amateur has encountered.

If you have questions or feedback, feel free to reach out in the issues or discussions!

## Bootstrapping

This section is incomplete and fragmented, but contains important reference
notes for stuff I always forget.

### NixOS

#### Setup

```sh
nix-env -f '<nixpkgs>' -iA nixos-install-tools git bat fd ripgrep tealdeer vim
alias nix="nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'"
export NEW_HOSTNAME=<your-hostname>
export GIT_BRANCH="add-${NEW_HOSTNAME}"
```

#### Partitioning and formatting

<details>
<summary><b>Option 1: Disko</b></summary>

```sh
curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/montchr/dotfield/${GIT_BRANCH}/machines/${NEW_HOSTNAME}/disk-config.nix" -o /tmp/disk-config.nix
nix run github:nix-community/disko -- --mode disko /tmp/disk-config.nix
# to verify:
mount | grep /mnt
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Option 2: Manually</b></summary>

TODO: copy rough commands from moraine provisioning script

</details>

#### Configurate

```sh
git clone https://github.com/montchr/dotfield.git -b "${GIT_BRANCH}" /mnt/etc/nixos
# absolute paths from `/mnt` would break once booted into the system
cd /mnt/etc && ln -s nixos dotfield && cd nixos
nixos-generate-config --no-filesystems --root /mnt
```

Integrate any missing configuration from the generator locally, push to remote, and pull on the host.

#### Install

```sh
nixos-install --flake ".#${NEW_HOSTNAME}"
```

After rebooting, edit `~/.ssh/known_hosts` on your local machine to remove the initial entries since the host keys have been reset after installation.

#### Record Public Keys

```sh
export KEYS_DIR="$PRJ_ROOT/cells/ops/data/keys"
export NEW_HOSTNAME=<...>
export NEW_HOSTIP=<...>

ssh root@$NEW_HOSTIP -t 'cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub' \
> "$KEYS_DIR/ssh/$NEW_HOSTNAME.pub"

ssh root@$NEW_HOSTIP -t 'cat /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub' \
> "$KEYS_DIR/ssh/$NEW_HOSTNAME-rsa.pub"

nix run nixpkgs#ssh-to-age -- -i "$KEYS_DIR/ssh/$NEW_HOSTNAME.pub" \
| tr --delete '\n' \
> "$KEYS_DIR/age/$NEW_HOSTNAME.txt"

git add $KEYS_DIR
```

#### Update Secret Recipients

Add the host to `//cells/secrets/cfg/sops.nix`, then:

```sh
direnv reload
grep "$NEW_HOSTNAME" $PRJ_ROOT/.sops.yaml --before-context=10
sops updatekeys secrets/global.secrets.yaml
```

### Generic Linux

TODO

Only home-manager support is possible here.

### macOS/Darwin

Something along these lines:

- `sudo xcode-select --install`
- Install Homebrew
- `brew install git bash zsh ripgrep fd tealdeer bat coreutils`
- Add Homebrew `PATH` entries to `~/.zprofile` as directed
- Install Nix
- Generate SSH keys for your user and add them to GitHub/Sourcehut.
- `mkdir -p ~/.config`
- `git clone git@github.com:montchr/dotfield.git ~/.config/dotfield`
- Create a basic config for the new host in `./darwin/machines/<hostname>/default.nix`
- Add the new host to `flake.darwinConfigurations.<hostname>` in `./darwin/configurations.nix`
- `nix build .#darwinConfigurations.<hostname>.system --verbose`
- `./result/sw/bin/darwin-rebuild switch --flake .#<hostname>` (assuming that
  the desired hostname has not yet been set -- otherwise, `... --flake .` should suffice)

### Secrets

After the initial generation with secrets disabled (due to a
catch-22/bootstrapping problem), you should then be able to do the following
with a smartcard attached.

```sh
export KEYID="0x135EEDD0F71934F3"
gpg --recv $KEYID
gpg --list-secret-keys
gpg-agent-restart

mkdir -p $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age
# Required for editing sops files
pass show age--secret-key >> $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sops/age/keys
```

## Structure

I still don't know what I'm doing.
Maybe one day I will have enough of an idea that I can write it down with any amount of coherence.
Or maybe I'm doing it all backwards…?

## Grafts

Generally in order of [frecency][frecency], along with an optional description
of reasons for inclusion.

More recently, I've aimed to reference sources with comments and SPDX headings
in relevant files.

### `HodgePodge` aka the "Sacred Chao"

An early-2014 15-inch MacBook Pro who has seen quite the life. Mostly unused for
the past several years due to the availability of more portable work laptops. It
is now living out its life in a declarative retirement home. `nixos-rebuild` is
impossibly slow, even with the binary cache and `ryosuke` as build host.

### Incubation

#### `sommoch` [damaged+misplaced]

Dead but dreaming.

Laid to indefinite rest when one of the cats, seeking human attention, chewed
through the LCD screen. We did not speak for a week.

Still works, but unusable without external display.

Suffers from congenital Butterfly Keyboard Syndrome. Runs macOS.

Currently lost somewhere in the meat ether. According to "Find My Devices",
someone may have accidentally left it at an Airbnb in Massachusetts. But I've
never been to Massachusetts.

## Notes

### macOS GUI Applications via Nix: Don't Bother

I oscillate between using emacs-plus via homebrew, nix-darwin's
`services.emacs`, and home-manager's `programs.emacs`, only to switch back to
brew-installed emacs-plus.

Unfortunately my experience with installing macOS GUI applications with Nix has
been consistently terrible. Though that is not at all the fault of the Nix
community -- we can point all fingers at Apple for making things difficult
outside of their intended usages.

So I write this as a reminder to my future self to err on the side of not
wasting the time trying to make macOS GUI apps work with Nix.

#### Emacs

Avoid using GUI Emacs installed via home-manager. In my experience, it crashes
any time I interact with the mouse or use the menubar. This one is probably
worth reporting upstream, but admittedly I am rolling a weird custom patched
version of Emacs 29 from the community overlay with the emacs-plus patches
included, so that might make it hard for others to repro.

nix-darwin Emacs doesn't have GUI crashes, but the launchd service never seems
to work, breaking `emacsclient` functionality.

Unverified, but I suspect that the home-manager-managed Emacs GUI crashes
because macOS doesn't like the `emacs-with-packages` wrapper from
`programs.emacs.finalPackage`.

#### yabai

I miss using yabai, a lot. I uninstalled it when I upgraded to Ventura because
there were some pretty significant issues causing it to crash constantly. I
think those may have been fixed since I last tried.

But this is another example: just save yourself the anguish and time-suck and
just use the official Homebrew installation. yabai is brilliantly hacky (in a
good way) enough on its own, and when it's broken, the system becomes literally
unusable (thanks again, Apple).
