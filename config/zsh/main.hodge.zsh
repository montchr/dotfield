# Clone additional Git repositories from GitHub.

# example. If you don't plan to use Oh My Zsh, delete this line.

# initialize Zsh. After this point console I/O is unavailable until Zsh
# is fully initialized. Everything that requires user interaction or can
# perform network I/O must be done above. Everything else is best done below.
